# Recurrent-and-Graph-Neural-Networks
This project provides a hands-on implementation of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) using PyTorch. It covers:

* **LSTM and GRU for Classification:** Implements LSTM and GRU models for image classification on the FashionMNIST dataset.
* **GCN for Node Classification:** Implements a 2-layer GCN for node classification on the Cora citation network dataset. Explores the concept of heterophily and its impact on GCN performance.
* **Graph Autoencoder (GAE) for Link Prediction:** Implements a GAE using a GCN encoder for link prediction on the Cora dataset.

This project is ideal for anyone learning about RNNs, GCNs, and their applications in various machine learning tasks.

## Usage

1. **LSTM/GRU for Classification:**
    * Run the code in section 1 to train and evaluate LSTM and GRU models on the FashionMNIST dataset.
2. **GCN for Node Classification:**
    * Run the code in section 2 to train and evaluate a GCN model on the Cora dataset.
    * Explore the impact of heterophily by running the code in Task 10.
3. **GAE for Link Prediction:**
    * Run the code in Task 11 to train and evaluate a GAE for link prediction on the Cora dataset.

## Key Features

* **RNN Implementations:** Provides implementations of LSTM and GRU models from scratch.
* **GCN Implementation:** Implements a 2-layer GCN from scratch.
* **Heterophily Analysis:** Explores the concept of heterophily and its impact on GCN performance.
* **Link Prediction with GAE:** Demonstrates how to use a GCN encoder for link prediction in a GAE.
* **Clear Explanations:** Includes comments and explanations within the code to guide understanding.
* **Visualization:** Uses matplotlib to visualize training progress and results.
